    abstract = "{Individuals with low income may have heightened rates of obesity and hypertension.To determine whether prenatal and infancy home visitation by nurses reduces maternal and offspring obesity and hypertension.This randomized clinical trial of prenatal and infancy nurse home visitation in a public health care system in Memphis, Tennessee, enrolled 742 women with no previous live births and at least 2 sociodemographic risk factors (unmarried, \\&lt;12 years of education, unemployed) from June 1, 1990, through August 31, 1991. At registration during pregnancy, 727 mothers (98\\%) were unmarried, and 631 (85\\%) lived below the federal poverty level. At offspring ages 12 and 18 years, maternal and offspring obesity and hypertension were assessed by staff masked to treatment. The data analysis was performed from July 1, 2021, to October 31, 2023.Women assigned to the control group received free transportation for prenatal care and child developmental screening and referral at child ages 6, 12, and 24 months. Women assigned to nurse visitation received transportation and screening plus prenatal and infant and toddler nurse home visits.Obesity and hypertension among mothers and their offspring at child ages 12 and 18 years, although not hypothesized in the original trial design, were analyzed using post–double selection lasso method.Of the 742 participants randomized (mean [SD] age, 18.1 [3.2] years), interviews were completed with 594 mothers and 578 offspring at child age 12 years and 618 mothers and 629 offspring at child age 18 years. Obesity was assessed for 576 offspring at age 12 years and 605 at age 18 years and for 563 and 598 mothers at child ages 12 and 18 years, respectively. Blood pressure was assessed for 568 offspring aged 12 years and 596 aged 18 years and 507 and 592 mothers at child ages 12 and 18 years, respectively. There were no overall treatment-control differences in offspring obesity or hypertension at ages 12 and 18 years combined, although nurse-visited female offspring, compared with controls, had a lower prevalence of obesity (adjusted relative risk [ARR], 0.449; 95\\% CI, 0.234-0.858; P = .003) and severe obesity (ARR, 0.185; 95\\% CI, 0.046-0.748; P \\&lt; .001). There were reductions at ages 12 and 18 years combined for stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension for nurse-visited vs control group mothers, with differences limited to mothers of females (stage 1: ARR, 0.613 [95\\% CI, 0.440-0.855; P = .001]; stage 2: ARR, 0.217 [95\\% CI, 0.081-0.582; P \\&lt; .001]). For both obesity and hypertension outcomes, there was no intervention effect among male offspring or the mothers of males. Self-reported maternal health aligned with program effects on hypertension.In this clinical trial follow-up at offspring ages 12 and 18, nurse-visited female offspring had lower rates of obesity and mothers of females had lower rates of hypertension than control-group counterparts. These findings suggest that risks for chronic disease among mothers of females and their female offspring who live in extreme poverty may be prevented with prenatal and infant and toddler home visitations by nurses.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00708695}",
